## Points to note

- Jamulus can be compiled for Linux, Windows and macOS. However, the preferred method of supporting these platforms is to use the binaries generated by the autobuild process in the Jamulus repository.
- For unattended installs, see the contributed [installation scripts](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/installscripts)
- There are reports from people who successfully compile and run Jamulus on BSDs.
- Android and iOS are not officially supported.

## Download sources

For .tar.gz [use this link](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/archive/latest.tar.gz) to download the latest release

## Linux

### Install dependencies

On Ubuntu-based distributions 18.04+, Debian 9+, and Raspberry Pi OS:

- build-essential
- qt5-qmake
- qtdeclarative5-dev
- qt5-default
- qttools5-dev-tools
- libjack-jackd2-dev

### On Fedora 33+

- qt5-qtdeclarative-devel
- jack-audio-connection-kit-dbus
- qt5-qtbase
- jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
- qt5-linguist

### For all desktop distributions

[QjackCtl](https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/) is optional, but recommended to configure JACK.

### Standard desktop build

```shell
make distclean
qmake # qmake-qt5 on Fedora 33
make
sudo make install
```

`make distclean` is optional but ensures a clean build environment. `make install` is optional and puts the Jamulus binary into `/usr/local/bin`.

### “Headless” server build

Although not strictly necessary, we recommend using the headless flag to avoid having to install some of the dependent packages, save some disk space and/or speed up your build time.

Note that you don’t need to install the JACK package(s) for a headless build. If you plan to run headless on Gentoo, or are compiling under Ubuntu for use on another Ubuntu machine, the only packages you should need for a headless build are `qtcore`, `qtnetwork`, `qtconcurrent` and `qtxml` (both for building and running the server).

Compile the sources to ignore the JACK sound library:

```shell
make distclean # recommended
qmake "CONFIG+=nosound headless"
make
sudo make install # optional
```

To control the server with systemd, see this [unit file example](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/blob/master/distributions/debian/jamulus-headless.service). See also runtime [configuration options](https://jamulus.io/wiki/Running-a-Server#command-line-options), and [this manual](https://jamulus.io/wiki/Server-Linux).

## Windows

You will need [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download)

- Use the free GPLv2 license for Open Source development
- Select Components during installation: Expand the Qt section, find the matching version, preferrably **Qt 5.15.2**, and add the compiler components for your compiler, e.g., `MSVC 2019 32-bit/64-bit` for Visual Studio 2019
- [ASIO development files](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html)

### Compiling and building installer

Most users will probably want to use this method:

1. Open PowerShell
1. Navigate to the `jamulus` directory
1. To allow unsigned scripts, right-click on the `windows\deploy_windows.ps1` script, select properties and allow the execution of this script. You can also run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`. (You can revert this after having run this script. For more information see the [Microsoft PowerShell documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy)).
1. Edit the $QtCompile32 and $QtCompile64 variables.
1. Run the Jamulus compilation and installer script in PowerShell: `.\windows\deploy_windows.ps1`.
1. You can now find the Jamulus installer in the `.\deploy` directory.

### Compiling only

1. Create a folder under `\windows` called ASIOSDK2
1. Download the [ASIOSDK](https://www.steinberg.net/asiosdk), open the top level folder in the .zip file and copy the contents into `[\path\to\jamulus\source]\windows\ASIOSDK2` so that, e.g., the folder `[\path\to\jamulus\source]\windows\ASIOSDK2\common` exists
1. Open Jamulus.pro in Qt Creator, configure the project with a default kit, then compile & run

---

## macOS

You will need XCode and Qt as follows:

```shell
brew install qt5
brew link qt5 --force
```

### Generate XCode Project file

`qmake -spec macx-xcode Jamulus.pro`

### Print build targets and configuration in console

`xcodebuild -list -project Jamulus.xcodeproj`

will prompt

```shell
Targets:
    Jamulus
    Qt Preprocess

Build Configurations:
    Debug
    Release
```

If no build configuration is specified and `-scheme` is not passed then "Release" is used.

```shell
Schemes:
    Jamulus
```

### Build the project

`xcodebuild build`

Will build the file and make it available in `./Release/Jamulus.app`

## iOS

1. Install [Xcode from the Mac AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
2. [Download and install qt5 with the Qt Installer](https://www.qt.io/download) (not homebrew). Explicitly select iOS when choosing the Qt version
3. Go to the folder of the Jamulus source code via terminal and run `/path/to/qt/5.15.2/ios/bin/qmake -spec macx-xcode Jamulus.pro` to generate an .xcodeproject file
4. Open the generated .xcodeproject in Xcode
5. Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab and fix signing errors by setting a team. Xcode will tell you what you need to change.

- If have a free Apple Developer Account, you can use it as a "Personal Team":
- Set it up under Xcode Menu->Preferences->Accounts.
- Then choose a Bundle Identifier at your choice in the relevant field in the "General" Tab (in section "Identity")
- Now click on the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. In the section "Signing", the "Automatically manage signing" option should be selected.
- You should now see Team: (Your Name) (Personal Team), Bundle identifier: (the same you modified on General Tab), Provisioning Profile: Xcode Management Profile, Signing Certificate: Apple Development (your e-mail used for signing in to Apple) below

6. Connect your device via USB (or WiFi if you set it up for that)
7. Select your device next to the play button
8. Compile and run Jamulus by clicking on the play button
9. Before being able to start Jamulus on your device, you'll have trust your developer profile in the device's Settings under General>Profiles & Device Management. For more information [see the guide by osxdaily](https://osxdaily.com/2021/05/07/how-to-trust-an-app-on-iphone-ipad-to-fix-untrusted-developer-message/)
10. After a week you might need to restart from step 6 to continue to run Jamulus on iOS, unless you are paying for the Apple developer programme.

## Android

- Install Qt, including the Android support from the Qt installer
- Follow Qt's [Getting Started with Qt for Android](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-getting-started.html) instructions
- Make sure Jamulus submodules are present, notably oboe:
  `git submodule update --init`
- Open Jamulus.pro in Qt Creator
- Now you should be able to Build & Run for Android.
