This is a listening client for Jamulus. Please note that you need to use a <b>cellular or ethernet connection</b> in order to use this app. WiFi will lead to massively degraded audio quality.

<b>What is Jamulus?</b>
Jamulus is for playing, rehearsing, or just jamming with your friends, your band or just anyone you find online. With high quality, low-latency sound on a normal broadband connection, it's easy to play together remotely and in time. It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.
<b>Recommended setup</b>
To enjoy good quality, low latency sound, use:
* Wired headphones, not Bluetooth (too much latency)
* A stable internet connection (4G, 5G, Ethernet, not WiFi)
* A good microphone/audio interface if you want to play along
