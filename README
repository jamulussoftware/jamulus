llcon, Internet Jam Session Software
------------------------------------

llcon, Low-Latency (Internet) Connection tool
Under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
http://llcon.sourceforge.net


INTRODUCTION:
The llcon software enables musicians to perform real-time jam sessions over
the internet. There is one server running the llcon server software which
collects the audio data from each llcon client software, mixes the audio data
and sends the mix back to each client.

The minimum internet connection speed at each client must be 128 kbps for up-
and downstream. To get satisfactory results, the ping time from the client
computer to the server should not exceed 40 ms average.

Llcon runs under Windows (ASIO), MacOS (Core Audio) and Linux (Jack). The llcon
software package includes both, the client and the server functionality which
can be selected by using command line arguments.

For starting server type ./llcon -s

The audio is compressed with the CELT audio codec to ensure a low delay and a
low upload/download rate.

For test purpose it is possible to run server and client on the same computer.
For this setup first start the server and then the client. Type in 127.0.0.1 for
the IP address in the client software.
