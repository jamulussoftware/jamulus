Welcome to Jamulus. Please note, latency optimization on Android has not been addressed and experiences will vary strongly from device to device. Trying to participate in jams should only be attempted when you're sure you have a good connection. The usual recommendations apply - a stable connection (4G/5G cellular; Ethernet; WiFi discouraged) and wired, non-Bluetooth headphones are essential. Try listening only first and see if the latency is suitable before trying to join in and jam.

<b>What is Jamulus?</b>
Jamulus is for playing, rehearsing, or just jamming with your friends, your band or just anyone you find online. With high quality, low-latency sound on a normal broadband connection, it's easy to play together remotely and in time. It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.
<b>Recommended setup</b>
To enjoy good quality, low latency sound, use:
* Wired headphones, not Bluetooth (too much latency)
* A stable internet connection (4G, 5G, Ethernet, not WiFi)
* A good microphone/audio interface if you want to play along
