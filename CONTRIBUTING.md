You want to contribute? We really appreciate that.
Please have a look at this list to facilitate your contribution:

* Before you start coding, create a Github issue at https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/issues. In that new issue write your specification and that you are planning to do the coding. Then we can discuss the specification. Only start coding after we agreed to a specification.
* If the Github issue for your feature/bug fix already exists, then write a message in that issue that you want to work on it.
* Respect the existing code style: Tab size=4, insert spaces.
* Make sure (if possible) that your code compiles on Windows/Mac/Linux.
* Do not use diff/patch to send your code changes but create a Github fork of the Jamulus code and create a Pull Request when you are done.
