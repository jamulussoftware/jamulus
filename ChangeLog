  parameters to use depending on the upload limit and the number of connected
  clients)


### 2.1.4 (2009-02-15) ###

- added automatic jitter buffer size setting

- speed optimizations to improve audio interface stability

  server according to the setting in the client (they are coupled now)

- removed sample rate offset estimation since it was not used anyway
