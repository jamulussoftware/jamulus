<!-- Thanks for specifying a new feature! -->

**Has this feature been discussed and generally agreed?**
<!-- Don't worry about requesting something that hasn't been discussed - we'll just move it to Discussion if we think it's unclear. But ideally, issues should have an agreed specification such that anyone could action it without much help. -->

**Describe the solution you'd like**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. --> 

**Describe alternatives that have been considered**
<!-- If some alternatives have been discussed, please briefly list those together with a reason(s) why they were decided against. This prevents a repeat of the previous discussions. Reference any relevant discussion threads if possible, and consider tagging the main participants. -->
