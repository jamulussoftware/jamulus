**What is the current behaviour and why should it be changed?**

<!-- Please give a precise description of the status quo and why this is not optimal. -->

**Describe possible approaches**

<!--
List possible approaches with pros and cons, reference any relevant discussion threads if possible, and consider tagging the main participants.

<!-- Describe the solution you'd like -->

**Has this feature been discussed and generally agreed?**

<!-- Don't worry about requesting something that hasn't been discussed - we'll just move it to Discussion if we think it's unclear. But ideally, issues should have an agreed, clear specification such that anyone could action it without much help. -->
